### Right-angled triangles

A *right angle* is an angle with value $90\degree$.

A *right-angled triangle* has one right angle. This is always the biggest angle in a right-angled triangle.

The longest side of a right-angled triangle is called the *hypotenuse*. This is always opposite the right-angle.

If we label the sides or a right-angled triangle $a$, $b$ and $c$ (The longest is $c$), then they satisfy the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

### Notes

If the biggest angle in a tirnagle is not a right angle, then it is not a right angled triangle.
