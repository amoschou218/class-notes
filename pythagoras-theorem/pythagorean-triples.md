# Pythagorean triples

## Investigation

> 1. Choose two whole numbers.
> 2. On graph paper, draw a rectangle with length and width equal to those two numbers.
> 3. Draw a diagonal across that rectangle to construct a right-angled triangle.
> 4. Measure the diagonal length.
> 5. Is it another whole number?

Most of the time, the answer to the question in step 5 is ‘no’.

Can you find any examples where the answer is ‘yes’? If you can, then you have found a *Pythagorean triple*.

## Definition

A *Pythagorean triple* is three whole numbers $\(a, b, c\)$ (the biggest one is $c$) that are related using the equation:
$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$

Equivalently, geometrically, a *Pythagorean triple* is three whole numbers that could be the side lengths of a right-angled triangle.

## Example

> Is $\(3, 4, 5\)$ a Pythagorean triple?
>
> Let’s check using algebra.\
> The biggest is $c = 5$. The others are $a = 3$ and $b = 4$ (It does not matter which is $a$ and which is $b$).\
> Substitute into the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\
> The left side is: $c^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\
> The right side is: $a^2 + b^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25$.\
> The equation is satisfied. Therefore, $\(3, 4, 5\)$ is a Pythagorean triple.
>
> Check using geometry.\
> Draw a rectangle 3 cm long and 4 cm wide. Draw its diagonal and measure its length.\
> If you precisely draw the diagram, you will find the diagonal is 5 cm long. (Which is expected because the algebra checks out above).\
> Note: Measuring this way is not conclusive because there might be some imperceptable differences (What if the diagonal were actually 5.01 cm and you didn’t notice?)
