## Pythagorean triples

### Investigation

> 1. Choose two whole numbers.
> 2. On graph paper, draw a rectangle with length and width equal to those two numbers.
> 3. Draw a diagonal across that rectangle to construct a right-angled triangle.
> 4. Measure the diagonal length.
> 5. Is it another whole number?

Most of the time, the answer to the question in step 5 is ‘no’.

Can you find any examples where the answer is ‘yes’? If you can, then you have found a *Pythagorean triple*.

### Definition

A *Pythagorean triple* is three whole numbers $\(a, b, c\)$ (the biggest one is $c$) that are related using the equation:
$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$

Equivalently, geometrically, a *Pythagorean triple* is three whole numbers that could be the side lengths of a right-angled triangle.

Note: This means that a question could be phrased as *Is this a Pythagorean triple?* or *Is this a right angled triangle?*. They are equivalent formulations of the same question.

### Example

> Is $\(3, 4, 5\)$ a Pythagorean triple?\
> *or*
> Is a triangle with side lengths 3, 4, 5 a right-angled triangle?
>
> Let’s check using algebra.\
> The biggest is $c = 5$. The others are $a = 3$ and $b = 4$ (It does not matter which is $a$ and which is $b$).\
> Substitute into the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\
> The left side is: $c^2 = 5^2 = 25$.\
> The right side is: $a^2 + b^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25$.\
> The equation is satisfied. Therefore, $\(3, 4, 5\)$ is a Pythagorean triple.\
> (Or a triangle with side lengths 3, 4, 5 is a right-angled triangle).
>
> Check using geometry.\
> Draw a rectangle 3 cm long and 4 cm wide. Draw its diagonal and measure its length.\
> If you precisely draw the diagram, you will find the diagonal is 5 cm long. (Which is expected because the algebra checks out above).\
> Note: Measuring this way is not conclusive because there might be some imperceptable differences (What if the diagonal were actually 5.01 cm and you didn’t notice?)

### Counter example

> Is $\(4, 7, 8\)$ a Pythagorean triple?\
> *or:*
> Is a triangle with side lengths 4, 7, 8 a right-angled triangle?
>
> Let’s check using algebra.\
> The biggest is $c = 8$. The others are $a = 4$ and $b = 7$ (Again, it does not matter which is $a$ and which is $b$).\
> Substitute into the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\
> The left side is: $c^2 = 8^2 = 64$.\
> The right side is: $a^2 + b^2 = 4^2 + 7^2 = 65$.\
> The equation is not satisfied. Therefore, $\(3, 4, 5\)$ is not a Pythagorean triple.\
> (Or a triangle with side lengths 4, 7, 8 is not a right-angled triangle).

### Similar triples

Pythagorean triples can be scaled up (or down) by a scale factor to generate a new Pythagorean triple. All three values must be scaled by the same amount.

> Is $\(9, 12, 15\)$ a Pythagorean triple?
> 
> Yes. Because we already know that $\(3, 4, 5\)$ is a Pythagorean triple, and multiplying these values by 3 produces $\(9, 12, 15\)$.
