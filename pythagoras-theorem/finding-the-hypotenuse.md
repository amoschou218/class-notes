## Finding the hypotenuse

Remember the equation: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ which applies to right-angled triangles (the hypotenuse is $c$).

Do not approximate your answer as a decimal unless the question asks for it.

### Example 1

Find the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose shorter sides are 5 and 12.

First, identify the variables:\
$a = 5$\
$b = 12$\
$c = \textrm{?}$

Now, substitute and rearrange to find $c$:
```math
\begin{align*}
c^2 &= a^2 + b^2\\
    &= 5^2 + 12^2\\
    &= 169\\
\Rightarrow c &= \sqrt{169}\\
&= 13
\end{align*}
```

### Example 2

Find the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose shorter sides are 4 and 6. Keep your answer in exact form, simplified.

First, identify the variables:\
$a = 4$\
$b = 6$\
$c = \textrm{?}$

Now, substitute and rearrange to find $c$:
```math
\begin{align*}
c^2 &= a^2 + b^2\\
    &= 4^2 + 6^2\\
    &= 52\\
\Rightarrow c &= \sqrt{52}\\
&= 2\sqrt{13}
\end{align*}
```

### Example 3

Find the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose shorter sides are 4 and 6. Round your answer to two decimal places.

From example 2 above, we already know that $c = \sqrt{52}$.

Now, $c = \sqrt{52} \approx 7.21$.
