# Finding a shorter side of a right-angled triangle

Remember the equation: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ which applies to right-angled triangles (the hypotenuse is $c$).

Do not approximate your answer as a decimal unless the question asks for it.

## Example 1

Find the remaining side of a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is 13 and another side is 12.

First, identify the variables:\
$a = \textrm{?}$\
$b = 12$\
$c = 13$

Now, substitute and rearrange to find $a$:
```math
\begin{align*}
c^2 &= a^2 + b^2\\
13^2 &= a^2 + 12^2\\
169 &= a^2 + 144\\
\Rightarrow a^2 &= 169 - 144\\
&= 25
\Rightarrow a &= \sqrt{25}\\
&= 5
\end{align*}
```

## Example 2

Find the remaining side of a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is 2.6 and another side is 2.4.

First, recognise that $2.6 = 13\times 0.2$ and $2.4 = 12\times 0.2$. And knowing that $\(5, 12, 13\)$ is a Pythagorean triple then the remaining side is $5\times 0.2 = 1$.

Letâ€™s check this result algebraically: $1^2 + 2.4^2 = 6.76$. And $2.6^2 = 6.76$.
